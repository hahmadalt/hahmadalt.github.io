    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <br>

    <h2>This page is my review of 292 Fortune St. Unit B, Atlanta, GA 30312</h2>

    <br>

    <h2>I lived here from October 2021 to July 2023</h2>

    <br>

    <h2>I will now discuss the pros and cons</h2>

    <br>

    <h2>Pros:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>The master bath toilet has one of those handy hose connections from the tank that help you...wash</li>
    </ol>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Cons:</h2>

            <p>Squirrels. Yes, you read that right. Take a look at the emails below (all private info redacted):</p>

    <p>I appreciate the issue was eventually fixed, but it took almost 2.5 months from the initial email. I didn't enjoy waking up to squirrels jumping on the roof, and scampering around during conference calls. I eventually bought a squirrel trap, in case it were to happen again. Thank you Forestry Suppliers, Inc. !</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this was not the end of the issue. Take a look at the next email:</p>

    <p>Yes, that's right. I actually got a picture of the squirrels mating while on the roof and sent it. Here are all the pictures from that day (click/tap left or right):</p>

          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="img3.jpeg" class="d-block w-100" alt="picture 3 of squirrel">
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="img4.jpeg" class="d-block w-100" alt="picture 4 of squirrel">
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <img src="img5.jpeg" class="d-block w-100" alt="picture 5 of squirrel">
          </div>
        </div>
        <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="prev">
          <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
        </button>
        <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="next">
          <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
        </button>
      </div>

    <br>

    <p>In short, it eventually got fixed (again). That's pretty much it about the squirrels. I didn't care for the squirrels.</p>
